# Summary of Token Tracking Simplification

## Changes Made

1. **Removed the `usage_logs` Table**
   - The database schema has been simplified by removing the redundant `usage_logs` table
   - All token tracking now exclusively uses the more comprehensive `request_logs` table

2. **Cleaned Up RLS Policies**
   - Removed redundant and overlapping policies for `request_logs` table
   - Consolidated RLS policies to create a clean, well-structured permission system

3. **Updated Code**
   - Removed all legacy table logging in `litellm_callbacks.py`
   - Removed the `log_to_legacy` parameter and related functionality
   - Simplified the token tracking implementation

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated `litellm_token_tracking.md` to reflect the simplified architecture
   - Removed all references to the legacy `usage_logs` table

## New RLS Policy Structure

The row-level security for `request_logs` now follows these clear rules:

1. **Authenticated users** can insert records (via `Allow authenticated users to insert request logs`)
2. **Anonymous users** can insert records (via `Allow anonymous users to insert request logs`)
3. **Users** can only view their own records (via `Users can view their own request logs`)
4. **Service role** has full access to all records (via `Service role has full access to request logs`)

This simplification will make the token tracking system more maintainable and easier to reason about.
