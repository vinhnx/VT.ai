# Summary of Token Tracking Simplification

## Changes Made

1. **Removed the `usage_logs` Table**
   - The database schema has been simplified by removing the redundant `usage_logs` table
   - All token tracking now exclusively uses the more comprehensive `request_logs` table
   - Created a dedicated migration script (`migrate_remove_usage_logs.py`) to safely remove the legacy table

2. **Cleaned Up RLS Policies**
   - Removed redundant and overlapping policies for `request_logs` table
   - Consolidated RLS policies to create a clean, well-structured permission system
   - Created a dedicated migration script (`update_request_logs_rls.py`) to ensure proper RLS policy setup

3. **Updated Code**
   - Removed all legacy table logging in `litellm_callbacks.py`
   - Removed the `log_to_legacy` parameter and related functionality
   - Updated references from `usage_history` to `request_logs` in `vtai/main.py` and `setup_supabase.py`
   - Fixed `await` pattern in Supabase query execution to prevent errors
   - Simplified the token tracking implementation

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated `litellm_token_tracking.md` to reflect the simplified architecture
   - Created additional documentation explaining the changes and troubleshooting
   - Removed all references to the legacy `usage_logs` table

## New RLS Policy Structure

The row-level security for `request_logs` now follows these clear rules:

1. **Authenticated users** can insert records (via `Allow authenticated users to insert request logs`)
2. **Users** can only view their own records (via `Allow users to view their own request logs`)
3. **Service role** has full access to all records (via `Allow service role to view all request logs`)

## Implementation Details

### Updated Data Structure

The `request_logs` table schema efficiently captures all needed information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.request_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    model TEXT,
    messages JSONB,
    end_user UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    status TEXT,
    response_time FLOAT,
    request_id TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    additional_details JSONB
);
```

The `additional_details` JSONB field stores token usage information that was previously in the `usage_logs` table, making it fully backward compatible.

### Migration Path

To implement these changes in a new environment, run:

1. First, update the RLS policies for the `request_logs` table:

   ```
   python scripts/update_request_logs_rls.py
   ```

2. Then, remove the `usage_logs` table (after ensuring all data is properly migrated):

   ```
   python scripts/migrate_remove_usage_logs.py
   ```

This simplification will make the token tracking system more maintainable and easier to reason about, while improving performance by eliminating redundant database operations.
