# VT.ai OAuth Implementation - Phase 1 Report

## Overview

This report documents the implementation of OAuth authentication in VT.ai using Supabase as the authentication provider. The implementation follows the roadmap outlined in the monetization plan and represents Phase 1 of the multi-phase approach.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Authentication Flow

We have successfully implemented a basic OAuth flow with the following components:

- **Supabase Integration**: Initialized and configured Supabase client for authentication
- **OAuth Providers**: Support for GitHub and Google authentication via Supabase OAuth
- **Session Management**: User sessions managed through Chainlit's user_session
- **Login/Logout UI**: Added UI elements for user authentication
- **Test Mode**: Fallback mode for users who are not authenticated

### 2. Token Usage Logging

To track usage for future monetization, we've implemented:

- **Supabase Table**: Created a `usage_logs` table to store token usage data
- **Usage Logging**: Integrated logging into conversation handlers
- **User Attribution**: Connected usage logs to authenticated users when available
- **Anonymous Usage**: Support for tracking anonymous (test mode) usage

### 3. Database Schema

The Supabase database includes:

- **usage_logs**: Records token consumption with model, user, and session information
- **user_subscriptions**: (Placeholder for Phase 2) Will store subscription information

### 4. UI Components

The user interface has been enhanced with:

- **Login Button**: Prominent login action in the header
- **Auth Status Display**: Visual indication of current authentication status
- **Test Mode Indicator**: Clear indication when operating in test mode
- **User Information**: Display of user details when authenticated

## Current Limitations

- **Manual Token Handling**: The OAuth flow currently requires manual token copying
- **No Subscription Tiers**: All users have the same access level in Phase 1
- **Limited User Profile**: No dedicated user profile or settings page yet
- **Basic RLS Policies**: Row-Level Security is implemented but may need refinement

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Run the Supabase setup script: `python scripts/setup_supabase.py`
2. Test the Supabase configuration: `python scripts/test_supabase_auth.py`
3. Run the application and test the login flow: `./scripts/run_vtai_app.sh`

A detailed testing guide is available in `docs/developer/oauth-testing-guide.md`.

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Improved OAuth Flow**: Replace manual token handling with a more seamless UI integration
2. **Stripe Integration**: Implement subscription management with Stripe
3. **Subscription Tiers**: Define and implement different access levels
4. **Usage Limits**: Add token limits based on subscription tier
5. **User Dashboard**: Create a user profile and subscription management page

## Conclusion

The Phase 1 implementation provides a solid foundation for user authentication and usage tracking. With this infrastructure in place, we can proceed to Phase 2 to implement subscription management and monetization features.
