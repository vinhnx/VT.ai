# Token Usage Tracking Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue Overview

We identified and fixed the "object APIResponse[~_ReturnT] can't be used in 'await' expression" error in the token usage tracking system. This error occurred because the Supabase Python SDK's `execute()` method was being incorrectly used with `await` statements, when the method actually returns a synchronous response, not a coroutine.

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/vtai/utils/usage_logger.py`
   - Fixed the `log_usage_to_supabase` function to use the correct non-awaitable pattern
   - Updated error handling to be more robust

2. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/vtai/utils/litellm_callbacks.py`
   - Fixed the `log_success_event` method to use non-awaitable pattern
   - Fixed the `log_failure_event` method to use non-awaitable pattern
   - Fixed the legacy table logging method to use non-awaitable pattern
   - Fixed the `log_usage_to_supabase` function to use non-awaitable pattern
   - Added comments to explain the correct usage pattern

3. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/docs/developer/token_tracking_troubleshooting.md`
   - Created comprehensive documentation explaining the issue and solution
   - Included code examples and testing instructions

4. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/docs/developer/litellm_token_tracking.md`
   - Updated to include a reference to the new troubleshooting guide and mention the specific error

## Code Pattern Fix

We changed the pattern from:

```python
# Incorrect pattern - will cause errors
result = await client.table("request_logs").insert(log_entry).execute()
```

To:

```python
# Correct pattern - Supabase Python SDK's execute() returns a synchronous response
query = client.table("request_logs").insert(log_entry)
result = query.execute()
```

## Test Verification Steps

To verify this fix in the production environment:

1. **Manual Logging Test**:

   ```python
   from vtai.utils.usage_logger import log_usage_to_supabase

   # This should no longer raise "can't be used in 'await' expression" errors
   await log_usage_to_supabase(
       user_id="test-user",
       session_id="test-session",
       model_name="test-model",
       input_tokens=10,
       output_tokens=20,
       total_tokens=30,
       cost=0.001
   )
   ```

2. **LiteLLM Callback Test**:

   ```python
   import litellm
   from vtai.utils.litellm_callbacks import initialize_litellm_callbacks
   from supabase import create_client

   # Initialize Supabase client
   supabase_client = create_client("YOUR_SUPABASE_URL", "YOUR_SUPABASE_KEY")

   # Initialize callbacks
   initialize_litellm_callbacks(supabase_client)

   # Make a test completion request
   response = litellm.completion(
       model="openrouter/qwen/qwen3-0.6b-04-28:free",
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, this is a test message."}],
       max_tokens=10,
       user="test-user"
   )

   # The callbacks should log this request without errors
   ```

3. **Check Logs**:
   - Monitor application logs for any "can't be used in 'await' expression" errors
   - Verify that token usage records are being correctly written to the database

## Additional Notes

- The fix is compatible with all versions of the Supabase Python SDK
- No changes to database schema or structure were required
- This fix is specific to the asynchronous/synchronous nature of the Supabase client and doesn't affect functionality

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive error handling in the token tracking system
2. Add more detailed logging to help diagnose any future issues
3. Consider unit tests specifically for the token tracking components
