# Token Usage Tracking Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue Overview

We identified and fixed the "object APIResponse[~_ReturnT] can't be used in 'await' expression" error in the token usage tracking system. This error occurred because the Supabase Python SDK's `execute()` method was being incorrectly used with `await` statements, when the method actually returns a synchronous response, not a coroutine.

Additionally, we simplified the token tracking system by removing the redundant `usage_logs` table and consolidating all tracking to use only the more comprehensive `request_logs` table.

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/vtai/utils/usage_logger.py`
   - Fixed the `log_usage_to_supabase` function to use the correct non-awaitable pattern
   - Updated error handling to be more robust
   - Removed all references to the legacy `usage_logs` table
   - Removed the `log_to_legacy` parameter and related functionality

2. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/vtai/utils/litellm_callbacks.py`
   - Fixed the `log_success_event` method to use non-awaitable pattern
   - Fixed the `log_failure_event` method to use non-awaitable pattern
   - Removed the legacy table logging method completely
   - Fixed the `log_usage_to_supabase` function to use non-awaitable pattern
   - Added comments to explain the correct usage pattern
   - Removed the `log_to_legacy` parameter from `initialize_litellm_callbacks`

3. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/vtai/main.py`
   - Updated references from `usage_history` to `request_logs` in the `track_usage` function
   - Updated the data structure to match the `request_logs` schema
   - Added `json` import to support JSONB data in request_logs

4. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/scripts/setup_supabase.py`
   - Updated references from `usage_history` to `request_logs` in table checks

5. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/docs/developer/token_tracking_troubleshooting.md`
   - Created comprehensive documentation explaining the issue and solution
   - Included code examples and testing instructions

6. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/docs/developer/litellm_token_tracking.md`
   - Updated to include a reference to the new troubleshooting guide and mention the specific error

7. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/docs/developer/token_tracking_simplification.md`
   - Updated to document the token tracking system simplification
   - Added details about database schema, RLS policies, and migration path

## Created New Files

1. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/scripts/migrate_remove_usage_logs.py`
   - Script to safely remove the legacy `usage_logs` table and related database objects

2. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/scripts/update_request_logs_rls.py`
   - Script to ensure proper RLS policies for the `request_logs` table

3. `/Users/vinh.nguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/VT.ai/scripts/verify_token_tracking_fix.py`
   - Simple test script to verify the fix works as expected

## Code Pattern Fix

We changed the pattern from:

```python
# Incorrect pattern - will cause errors
result = await client.table("request_logs").insert(log_entry).execute()
```

To:

```python
# Correct pattern - Supabase Python SDK's execute() returns a synchronous response
query = client.table("request_logs").insert(log_entry)
result = query.execute()
```

## Token Tracking Simplification

We simplified the token tracking system by:

1. Removing the redundant `usage_logs` table (created scripts for safe migration)
2. Updating all code to use only the comprehensive `request_logs` table
3. Fixing the RLS policies for the `request_logs` table to ensure proper access control
4. Updating the data structure to properly use the JSONB capabilities of `request_logs`

The new database schema efficiently captures all needed information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.request_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    model TEXT,
    messages JSONB,
    end_user UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    status TEXT,
    response_time FLOAT,
    request_id TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    additional_details JSONB
);
```

## Verification Requirements

Before deploying to production, the following should be verified:

1. **Database Operations**:
   - Confirm the `request_logs` table is capturing all token usage data correctly
   - Verify that RLS policies are working as expected

2. **Application Functionality**:
   - Verify that token usage is being tracked properly in real usage scenarios
   - Ensure no errors occur when token tracking functions are called

## Implementation in Production

To roll out these changes in a production environment:

1. First deploy the code changes to the application
2. Run the migration script to update RLS policies:

   ```
   python scripts/update_request_logs_rls.py
   ```

3. After confirming that all data is being properly captured in `request_logs`, run:

   ```
   python scripts/migrate_remove_usage_logs.py
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. Add more comprehensive error handling in the token tracking system
2. Add more detailed analytics views or functions
3. Implement automatic token usage aggregation for billing purposes
4. Add dashboard visualization for token usage monitoring
2. Add more detailed logging to help diagnose any future issues
3. Consider unit tests specifically for the token tracking components
